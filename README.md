# gambling_game

I created this game as part of a workshop for my Python Bootcamp when we were studying the linear and the binary search.

In this game I write a number guessing game in three different ways:

1. The computer will generate a random number, then you will try to guess it.
2. The computer will generate a random number, then the computer will try to guess it using linear search.
3. The computer will generate a random number, then the computer will try to guess it using binary search.


In the final part of this project I put everything together.
I create a function that when called, it asks the player to bet on whether the computer will or will not guess the correct number.
